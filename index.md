## WELCOME SECURITY ENTUSIAST

Welcome to this space dedicated to hacking and blockchain, I am Gekk, and my 2 great hobbies are Cybersecurity and Blockchain, one is my job today, and the second is my hobby, I invite you to join this community, where I will be sharing my learning in cybersecurity and try to link this knowledge to blockchain whenever possible.


## What is Block on Brink 

I created this community to share content with 2 objectives, one is to continue my apprenticeship in cybersecurity, explaining a content is the best way to master it, and I want this to be the place where I can share it for free with the community, and another is, to start a community of people who share my interests for cybersecurity and blockchain.

> This website documents the features of the current `main` branch of the Just the Docs theme. See [the CHANGELOG]({% link CHANGELOG.md %}) for a list of releases, new features, and bug fixes.

Just the Docs is a theme for generating static websites with [Jekyll]. You can write source files for your web pages using [Markdown], the [Liquid] templating language, and HTML.[^1] Jekyll builds your site by converting all files that have [front matter] to HTML. Your [Jekyll configuration] file determines which theme to use, and sets general parameters for your site, such as the URL of its home page.

Jekyll builds this Just the Docs theme docs website using the theme itself. These web pages show how your web pages will look *by default* when you use this theme. But you can easily *[customize]* the theme to make them look completely different!

Browse the docs to learn more about how to use this theme.
